## What is the GoodData UI SDK

The GoodData UI SDK is a React-based JavaScript library for building data-driven applications.
With the GoodData UI SDK, you can:
* Display saved visualizations from the GoodData platform using the [Visualization component](ht_embed_visualization.md).
* Create visualizations [programmatically on the fly](ht_create_visualization_programmatically).
* Connect interactive controls to your visualization to provide unique user experience (for example, an Attribute Filter dropdown).
* [Query GoodData](ht_access_gd_api_directly.md) for specific insights into your data to handle them with a custom component.

## Supported Technologies

The GoodData UI SDK is tested against and supports the following:

* Mac, Linux
* React 15.6.2, Angular 1, Angular 2
  * [How to Create Your First Visualization with GoodData UI SDK](ht_create_your_first_visualization.md)
  * [How to Use React Components in Angular 1.x](ht_use_react_components_in_angular_1.x.md)
  * [How to Use React Components in Angular 2+](ht_use_react_components_in_angular_2.x.md)
* TypeScript 2.3+, ES6, ES5

The GoodData UI SDK may work with other platforms and operating systems but has _not_ been thoroughly tested yet and may _not_ provide all functionalities.

Server-side rendering is _not_ supported.

## GoodData Platform Account

To use the GoodData UI SDK, you must have an account on the GoodData platform. If you do not have a GoodData account, contact a person in your company who administers GoodData projects or your GoodData Account Manager.
