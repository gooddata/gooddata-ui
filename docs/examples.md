Review the examples available at [GoodData React examples](https://github.com/gooddata/gooddata-react-components/tree/master/examples) to see what you can build using the GoodData.UI.

The examples contain live demos and code snippets that you can reuse in your project.

Use the examples to do any of the following:
* Create a visualization and a KPI
* Create a responsive chart
* Add a date picker
* Create a custom legend
* Add an attribute filter
